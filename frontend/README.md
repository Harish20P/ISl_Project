# ISL Conversion Project

## Overview
The ISL Conversion Project is a web application designed to facilitate the conversion between Indian Sign Language (ISL) and text/audio formats. This application provides various features, including:

- **Audio to ISL Conversion**: Convert spoken audio into ISL signs.
- **Text to ISL Conversion**: Convert written text into ISL signs.
- **ISL to Text Conversion**: Convert ISL signs back into written text.

The main goal of this project is to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and hearing-impaired communities by making it easier for users to understand and use Indian Sign Language.

## Features
- User-friendly interface for seamless navigation.
- Multiple conversion options: audio, text, and ISL.
- Authentication system to manage user sessions.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop devices.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- React Router (for routing)

### Installation

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
